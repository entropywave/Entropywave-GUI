# Entropy Wave Detection GUI (Streamlit)

This is the graphical front-end for interacting with entropy drift data collected from quantum coherence measurements.

## Features
- Upload T₁, T₂, and phase drift datasets
- Auto-tag data with velocity vectors (CMB, galactic, solar)
- Preview FFT, wavelet, and CWT graphs
- Export enriched datasets

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the app:
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
